My coding journey started this year (2016), really. 

From zero. 

(Ok, I have a few years experience doing some HTML/CSS and Wordpress stuff before. But I don't count those as being very techy.) 

What I did was attend a coding bootcamp in New York City.  The experience was like drinking water from a firehose.  It's not fun when there's just this ton of stuff you have to learn and you can only absorb (let alone _master_) a small part of it. It's especially not fun when some in your cohort were CS majors. Yeah. They'd seen this movie before. So, it was not easy. 

But it was easily the most rewarding thing I'd done in a while. 

## Structure

I will use this site as a time capsule of my journey. There's stuff to learn and frankly no convenient repository for my the mistakes I had to go through to learn what I want to learn. (Maybe one of the first blog posts I do will be on Technical Debt. Yeah.)

### Articles
Articles are designed to teach me (again) how to do what I wanted to do.  

These will be in tutorial format. My cliff notes to myself. The idea is to have these projects increase in complexity. Deliberate practice. So the initial layers document things a junior coder (me) learn in order to become a more senior one.  As the subtitle of this site says, 

> "In a year all this will sound so obvious."  

I expect to take my coding journey to something related to helping people. I want to start where I left off: *BotServer* - our final project, which was a node.js implementation of IBM Watson's various AI services. Then move back to some of the simpler stuff (CRUD, ORM, tic-tac-toe, AJAX, HTML/CSS and of course Python and Django.)

### Blogs
Blogs are my thoughts on things not directly technical. And other bloviations on various topics. They may or may not be related to the tutorials, but may very well be. I think it will be cleaner to separate the tutorials from the thoughts I had while on my tech journey. 

### Photos
I also take photos. So I'll find a way to show them in some decent order. And present them properly.

## About Me
![Me]({{ site.url }}/images/IMG_3199-small.JPG)
{: .pull-right}

I'm Marc Ira, a full stack junior developer. I work with Python / Django and HTML/CSS as well as jQuery/JavaScript. I recently (2016) graduated from a coding bootcamp in New York City. 

I am a career-switcher, having been a startup founder/co-founder (finance, business strategy, valuation, investor relations, you name it.) Anything not technical. Which sucked.  Hence the bootcamp.

In a previous life I was also in finance and investments, so FinTech is a natural segue for me. More on FinTech as we go along. I have a lovely wife and three great guys for sons. That's them in the picture above.

Do drop me a line, especially if you notice obvious n00b mistakes. In a year all this will sound so obvious.
