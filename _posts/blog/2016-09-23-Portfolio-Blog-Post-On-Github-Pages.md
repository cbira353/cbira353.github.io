A general welcome to the blog side of my porfolio site. 

# First Order of Business
I wanted to have a repository of my learning journey. It's just that at this stage of learning, I need to get my bearings. And review the snippets of code I wrote in order to understand what I did right (and wrong). So this is my first project - a portfolio site for my coding projects. 

I decided to split my writing into:

  a) Tutorials - mostly how I want to re-teach future me (via code and a how-to) how I arrived at a coding milepost, ; and 

  b) Blog posts, which are non-technical and more focused on learning reflections.

That way, my tutorials will be devoid of editorial.
