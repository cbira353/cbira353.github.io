The company I co-founded created smart electronics for electic vehicles. Specifically, the electronic 'brains' for the lithium-ion batteries.

Here is the logo I desiged for our use. (These artistic departures were much welcome relief to the spreadsheets, investor documentation and accounting I spent a bunch of time on.) 

In this post, I talk about how I took elements of our technology and created a poster for our show booth.

Naturally, we had to explain what the technology was. It was also necessary to decide on a color palette. I decided on grey with gold and electric blue trim. The first thing I played with was the Facebook logo. 

I thought it came out nice enough.


*I then began thinking of how to incorporate lithium-ion batteries with mobility.*

I thought of adding some elements of the technology itself. Like the fact that we could control the electric vehicles (EVs) from the cloud. And that the lithium-ion batteries were also communicating with our cloud server.  IoT in 2013. 

So here you see a cylinder shaped battery communicating with the cloud, and another battery just sitting there. (I took pictures of these initial sketches from my notebook, so you are also seeing the other side of the paper page.)

*I started narrowing the focus to a battery that is powered by electricity from the socket, but communicating upwards, and receiving downloads from the cloud.*

Now, the vehicles that would house the lithum-ion batteries were called pubilc motorcycle taxis. In our test market, Manila, they are called tricycles (also tuk-tuks in Thailand). There are millions off them.

The tricycles would be powered by electricity. But with the difference that these batteries provide smart telemetrics. That is why I show the electric cord coming from the tricycle, and a communication beacon emanating from the EV.

The diagram below begins to show investors our startup's business model. The image is part of a slide deck.

We were reselling mobile electricity, allowing the tricycle driver to pay-per-use and avoid the expensive front-end cost of purchasing the lithium-ion battery in one shot.  Once remote payment is received, the circuit is closed, and the digital sensor allows the use of the EV for public transportation. Our service made money each time any energy was used by the EV.

Putting it all together. This poster explains in words and in graphic format the benefits of our technology. Lithium-ion Stored Energy Resale.
